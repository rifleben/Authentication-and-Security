# Authentication and Security

This is a simple application that I am using to learn about the various levels of authentication and security in a web application.  I am using the following technologies (so far):

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
